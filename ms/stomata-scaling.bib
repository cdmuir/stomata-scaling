	abstract = {How strong is phenotypic selection on quantitative traits in the wild? We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients {\textbar}β{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients {\textbar}γ{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

	abstract = {The size of plant stomata (adjustable pores that determine the uptake of CO 
              2 
              and loss of water from leaves) is considered to be evolutionarily important. This study uses fossils from the major Southern Hemisphere family Proteaceae to test whether stomatal cell size responded to Cenozoic climate change. We measured the length and abundance of guard cells (the cells forming stomata), the area of epidermal pavement cells, stomatal index and maximum stomatal conductance from a comprehensive sample of fossil cuticles of Proteaceae, and extracted published estimates of past temperature and atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . We developed a novel test based on stochastic modelling of trait evolution to test correlations among traits. Guard cell length increased, and stomatal density decreased significantly with decreasing palaeotemperature. However, contrary to expectations, stomata tended to be smaller and more densely packed at higher atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . Thus, associations between stomatal traits and palaeoclimate over the last 70 million years in Proteaceae suggest that stomatal size is significantly affected by environmental factors other than atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . Guard cell length, pavement cell area, stomatal density and stomatal index covaried in ways consistent with coordinated development of leaf tissues.},

	abstract = {The canopies of large broad-leaf trees exhibit signiﬁcant heterogeneity in both micro-environmental conditions and leaf morphology. Whether the visible differences in the size and shape of leaves from the top and bottom of the crown are determined prior to bud break or result from different patterns of leaf expansion is not known. Analysis of ontogenetic changes of both the degree of lobing and vein density in Quercus rubra demonstrates that leaves throughout the crown are identical in size and shape at the time of bud break. Morphological adaptation to the local microenvironment takes place during the expansion phase and starts after the determination of the vascular architecture has been completed. Leaves from the bottom of the crown undergo greater expansion in the tissue close to the main veins than occurs either in the more peripheral tissue of the same leaf or anywhere in leaves from the top of the crown. This results in a water transport system that is well suited to the low evaporative rates near the bottom of the crown, but inadequate for the conditions found at the top of the tree. Acclimation of leaf form and function based upon differential expansion may be entirely driven by the local hydraulic demand during the expansion phase, resulting in leaf size and vein density being determined during development by the same hydraulic properties which will constrain the size of leaf that can be functionally supported at maturity.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantiﬁed uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Paciﬁc. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with signiﬁcant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identiﬁed areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	abstract = {Plant development has a significant postembryonic phase that is guided heavily by interactions between the plant and the outside environment. This interplay is particularly evident in the development, pattern and function of stomata, epidermal pores on the aerial surfaces of land plants. Stomata have been found in fossils dating from more than 400 million years ago. Strikingly, the morphology of the individual stomatal complex is largely unchanged, but the sizes, numbers and arrangements of stomata and their surrounding cells have diversified tremendously. In many plants, stomata arise from specialized and transient stem-cell like compartments on the leaf. Studies in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana have established a basic molecular framework for the acquisition of cell fate and generation of cell polarity in these compartments, as well as describing some of the key signals and receptors required to produce stomata in organized patterns and in environmentally optimized numbers. Here we present parallel analyses of stomatal developmental pathways at morphological and molecular levels and describe the innovations made by particular clades of plants.},

These two observations are in direct conﬂict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufﬁcient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of widespead genetic variation in, and strong selection on, individual traits indicates that substantial multivariate genetic constraints are likely to be present in natural populations.},

	abstract = {The capacity of plants to ﬁx carbon is ultimately constrained by two core plant attributes: photosynthetic biochemistry and the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the atmosphere to sites of carboxylation in chloroplasts, predominantly stomatal conductance. Analysis of fossilized plant remains shows that stomatal density (number per unit area, D) and size (length by width, S) have ﬂuctuated widely over the Phanerozoic Eon, indicating changes in maximum stomatal conductance. Parallel changes are likely to have taken place in leaf photosynthetic biochemistry, of which maximal rubisco carboxylation rate, Vcmax is a central element. We used measurements of S and D from fossilized plant remains spanning the last 400 Myr (most of the Phanerozoic), together with leaf gas exchange data and modeled Phanerozoic trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2]a, to calibrate a [CO2]a-driven model of the long-term environmental inﬂuences on S, D and Vcmax. We show that over the Phanerozoic large changes in [CO2]a forced S, D and Vcmax to co-vary so as to reduce the impact of the change in [CO2]a on leaf CO2 assimilation for minimal energetic cost and reduced nitrogen requirements. Underlying this is a general negative correlation between S and D, and a positive correlation between water-use efﬁciency and [CO2]a. Furthermore, the calculated steady rise in stomatal conductance over the Phanerozoic is consistent with independent evidence for the evolution of plant hydraulic capacity, implying coordinated and sustained increase in gas exchange capacity and hydraulic capacity parallel long-term increases in land plant diversity.},

              Stomata control gas exchanges between the plant and the atmosphere. How natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve trade‐offs between carbon uptake and water loss in response to local climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation in stomatal patterning in 330 fully sequenced 
              Arabidopsis thaliana 
              accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We compared this to variation in water‐use efficiency, measured as carbon isotope discrimination (δ 
              13 
              C). We detect substantial genetic variation for stomata size and density segregating within 
              Arabidopsis thaliana 
              . A positive correlation between stomata size and δ 
              13 
              C further suggests that this variation has consequences on water‐use efficiency. Genome wide association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying not only variation in stomatal patterning but also to its covariation with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting δ 
              13 
              C independently of stomatal patterning. This suggests that, in 
              A. thaliana 
              , both morphological and physiological variants contribute to genetic variance in water‐use efficiency. Patterns of regional differentiation and covariation with climatic parameters indicate that natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation, especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favour the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape strategies.},

            The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a fundamental driver of climate, but its value is difficult to determine for times older than the roughly 800,000 years for which ice core records are available. The Cenozoic Carbon dioxide Proxy Integration Project (CenCO2PIP) Consortium assessed a comprehensive collection of proxy determinations to define the atmospheric carbon dioxide record for the past 66 million years. This synthesis provides the most complete record yet available and will help to better establish the role of carbon dioxide in climate, biological, and cryosphere evolution. —H. Jesse Smith

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO
                2
                ) emissions have driven an increase in the global atmospheric CO
                2
                concentration from 280 parts per million (ppm) before industrialization to an annual average of 419 ppm in 2022, corresponding to an increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) of 1.1°C over the same period. If global CO
                2
                emissions continue to rise, atmospheric CO
                2
                could exceed 800 ppm by the year 2100. This begs the question of where our climate is headed. The geologic record is replete with both brief and extended intervals of CO
                2
                concentration higher than today and thus provides opportunities to project the response of the future climate system to increasing CO
                2
                . For example, it has been estimated that global surface temperature 50 million years ago (Ma) was {\textasciitilde}12°C higher than today, in tandem with atmospheric CO
                2
                concentrations some 500 ppm higher (i.e., more than doubled) than present-day values. Consistent with these estimates, Antarctica and Greenland were free of ice at that time. However, reconstructing these values prior to direct instrumental measurements requires the use of paleoproxies—measurable properties of geological archives that are closely, but only indirectly, related to the parameter in question (e.g., temperature, CO
                2
                ). To date, at least eight different proxies from both terrestrial and marine archives have been developed and applied to reconstruct paleo-CO
                2
                , but their underlying assumptions have been revised over time, and published reconstructions are not always consistent. This uncertainty complicates quantification of the climate responses to the ongoing rise of atmospheric CO
                2
                concentrations.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Although earlier studies have compiled published paleo-CO
                2
                estimates, those studies typically applied only limited proxy vetting, included estimates that were made before the proxies were sufficiently validated, and/or focused on only a subset of available proxy data. The international consortium of the Cenozoic CO
                2
                Proxy Integration Project (CenCO
                2
                PIP) has undertaken a 7-year effort to document, evaluate, and synthesize published paleo-CO
                2
                records from all available archives, spanning the past 66 million years. The most reliable CO
                2
                estimates were identified, some records were recalculated to conform with the latest proxy understanding, age models were updated where necessary and possible, and data were categorized according to the community’s level of confidence in each estimate. The highest-rated data were eventually combined into a reconstruction of the Cenozoic history of atmospheric CO
                2
                .
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                The resulting reconstruction illustrates a more quantitatively robust relationship between CO
                2
                and global surface temperature, yielding greater clarity and confidence than previous syntheses. The new record suggests that early Cenozoic “hothouse” CO
                2
                concentrations peaked around 1600 ppm at {\textasciitilde}51 Ma. Near 33.9 Ma, the onset of continent-wide Antarctic glaciation coincided with an atmospheric CO
                2
                concentration of 720 ppm. By {\textasciitilde}32 Ma, atmospheric CO
                2
                had dropped to 550 ppm, and this value coincided with the onset of radiation in plants with carbon-concentrating mechanisms that populate grasslands and deserts today. CO
                2
                remained below this threshold for the remainder of the Cenozoic and continued its long-term decrease toward the present. Along this trajectory, the middle Miocene ({\textasciitilde}16 Ma) marks the last time that CO
                2
                concentrations were consistently higher than at present; Greenland was not yet glaciated at that time, and independent estimates suggest that sea level was some 50 m higher than today. Values eventually dropped below 270 ppm at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (2.6 Ma), when Earth approached our current “icehouse” state of bipolar glaciation. This and other climatic implications of the revised CO

              CONCLUSION
              
                This community-vetted CO
                2
                synthesis represents the most reliable data available to date and a means to improve our understanding of past changes in global climate and carbon cycling as well as organismal evolution. However, this effort is still incomplete. Data remain sparse during the earlier part of the record and in some instances are dominated by estimates from a single proxy system. Generating a paleo-CO
                2
                record with even greater confidence will require further research using multiple proxies to fill in data gaps and increase overall data resolution, resolve discrepancies between estimates from contemporaneous proxy analyses, reduce uncertainty of established methods, and develop new proxies.

	abstract = {"Evolutionary quantitative genetics (EQG) provides a formal theoretical foundation for quantitatively linking natural selection and genetic variation to the rate and expanse of adaptive evolution. It has become the dominant conceptual framework for interpreting the evolution of quantitative traits in terms of elementary forces (mutation, inheritance, selection, and drift). Despite this success, the relevance of EQG to many biological scenarios remains relatively unappreciated, with numerous fields yet to fully embrace its approach. Part of the reason for this lag is that conceptual advances in EQG have not yet been fully synthesized and made accessible to a wider academic audience. A comprehensive, accessible overview is therefore now timely, and Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics provides this much-needed synthesis. The central argument of the book is that an adaptive landscape concept can be used to understand both evolutionary process within lineages and the pattern of adaptive radiations. In particular, it provides a convincing argument that models with a moving adaptive peak carry us further than any other conceptual approach yet devised. Although additive theory holds center stage, the book mentions and references departures from additivity including non-Gaussian distributions of allelic effects, dominance, epistasis, maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity. This accessible, advanced textbook is aimed principally at students (from senior undergraduate to postgraduate) as well as practising scientists in the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, physiology, functional morphology, developmental biology, comparative biology, paleontology, and beyond who are interested in how adaptive radiations are produced by evolutionary and ecological processes."--Back cover},

	abstract = {The concept of evolvability emerged in the early 1990s and soon became fashionable as a label for different streams of research in evolutionary biology. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, evolvability is defined as the ability of a population to respond to directional selection. This differs from other fields by treating evolvability as a property of populations rather than organisms or lineages and in being focused on quantification and short-term prediction rather than on macroevolution. While the term evolvability is new to quantitative genetics, many of the associated ideas and research questions have been with the field from its inception as biometry. Recent research on evolvability is more than a relabeling of old questions, however. New operational measures of evolvability have opened possibilities for understanding adaptation to rapid environmental change, assessing genetic constraints, and linking micro- and macroevolution.},

              When it comes to fitting simple allometric slopes through measurement data, evolutionary biologists have been torn between regression methods. On the one hand, there is the ordinary least squares (
              OLS
              ) regression, which is commonly used across many disciplines of biology to fit lines through data, but which has a reputation for underestimating slopes when measurement error is present. On the other hand, there is the reduced major axis (
              RMA
              ) regression, which is often recommended as a substitute for
              OLS
              regression in studies of allometry, but which has several weaknesses of its own. Here, we review statistical theory as it applies to evolutionary biology and studies of allometry. We point out that the concerns that arise from measurement error for
              OLS
              regression are small and straightforward to deal with, whereas
              RMA
              has several key properties that make it unfit for use in the field of allometry. The recommended approach for researchers interested in allometry is to use
              OLS
              regression on measurements taken with low (but realistically achievable) measurement error. If measurement error is unavoidable and relatively large, it is preferable to correct for slope attenuation rather than to turn to
              RMA
              regression, or to take the expected amount of attenuation into account when interpreting the data.},

	abstract = {A new statistical method called the phylogenetic regression is proposed that applies multiple regression techniques to cross-species data. It allows continuous and categorical variables to be tested for and controlled for. The new method is valid despite the problem that phylogenetically close species tend to be similar, and is designed to be used when information about the phylogeny is incomplete. Information about the phylogeny of the species is assumed to be available in the form of a working phylogeny, which contains multiple nodes representing ignorance about the order of splitting of taxa. The non-independence between species is divided into that due to recognized phylogeny, that is, to phylogenetic associations represented in the working phylogeny; and that due to unrecognized phylogeny. The new method uses one linear contrast for each higher node in the working phylogeny, thus applying the ‘radiation principle’. For binary phylogenies the method is similar to an existing method. A criterion is suggested in the form of a simulation test for deciding on the acceptability of proposed statistical methods for analysing cross-species data with a continuous y-variable. This criterion is applied to the phylogenetic regression and to some other methods. The phylogenetic regression passes this test; the other methods tested fail it. Arbitrary choices have to be made about the covariance structure of the error in order to implement the method. It is argued that error results from omitted but relevant variables, and the implications for those arbitrary choices are discussed. One conclusion is that the dates of splits between taxa, even supplemented by rates of neutral gene evolution, do not provide the ‘ true ’ covariance structure. A pragmatic approach is adopted. Several analytical results about the phylogenetic regression are given, without proof, in a mathematical appendix. A computer program has been written in GLIM to implement the phylogenetic regression, and readers are informed how to obtain a copy.},

            Plants often experience multiple stresses in a given day or season, and it is self-evident that given functional traits can provide tolerances of multiple stresses. Yet, the multiple functions of individual traits are rarely explicitly considered in ecology and evolution due to a lack of a quantitative framework. We present a theory for considering the combined importance of the several functions that a single trait can contribute to alleviating multiple stresses. We derive five inter-related general predictions: (1) that trait multifunctionality is overall highly beneficial to fitness; (2) that species possessing multifunctional traits should increase in abundance and in niche breadth; (3) that traits are typically optimized for multiple functions and thus can be far from optimal for individual functions; (4) that the relative importance of each function of a multifunctional trait depends on the environment; and (5) that traits will be often “co-opted” for additional functions during evolution and community assembly. We demonstrate how the theory can be applied quantitatively by examining the multiple functions of leaf trichomes (hairs) using heuristic model simulations, substantiating the general principles. We identify avenues for further development and applications of the theory of trait multifunctionality in ecology and evolution.},
